Overview
========

papaw is a decompressing packer for executables running as root. It is designed
to be portable across different kernel versions, therefore it avoids the use of
fexecve() and other system calls which can be used to simplify it.

Usage
=====

papaw uses Meson (http://mesonbuild.com/) as its build system. To pack an
executable using papaw, build papaw, then use papawify to pack the executable.

papaw can be used as a Meson subproject; in that case, custom_target() is the
recommended way to run papawify.
